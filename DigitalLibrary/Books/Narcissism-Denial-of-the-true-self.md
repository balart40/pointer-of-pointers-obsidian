## Introduction

Narcissism describes both a psychological and cultural condition.

Individual level:
- Denotes a personality disturbance characterized by investment on one's image at the expense of the self.

Narcissist are more concerned how they appear than what they feel.

They deny feelings that contradict the image they seek

They Strive for power and control

On the cultural level:
- Lack of concern for the environment, for the quality of life, for one's fellow human beings.
- Image over loss of human values

The narcissism of the individual parallels that of the culture. We shape our culture according to our image.

Many are quite successful in their work, which suggest a split between the way they perform in the world and what goes on inside.

My theme is that narcissism denotes a degree of unreality in the individual and in the culture. 
Unreality is not just neurotic, it verges on the psychotic.

There is something crazy about a person who is out of touch with the reality of his or her being - the body and its feelings.

In general, insanity is seen as the mark of an individual who is out of touch  with the reality of his or her culture.

And we need to know what is to be human, if we are to avoid becoming narcissists.

My treatment of narcissistic patients is directed toward helping them get in touch with their bodies, to recover their suppressed feelings and to regain their lost humanity.

Without understanding, no therapeutic approach or technique is meaningful or effective on a deep level.

All patients are desperate for someone who will understand them.

They were not seen as individuals with feelings, not treated with respect for their humanity.
