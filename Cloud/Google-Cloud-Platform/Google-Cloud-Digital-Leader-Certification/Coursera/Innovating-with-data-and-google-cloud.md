## Module 2

### Data Migration

Data On-premises
- You are responsible for maintenance, IT infrastructure
- Risk downtime

Cloud
- With the cloud, you can scale up and/or down
- Analysis can be done quicker

### Cloud databases

Data integrity and Scale are top priorities

#### Cloud SQL

Cloud SQL is a fully managed Relational Database Management Service,  or RDBMS. It's easily integrated with existing applications and Google Cloud services like Google Kubernetes Engine and BigQuery and built on the performance innovation in Compute Engine.  Cloud SQL is compatible with common database management systems and methodologies.
#### Cloud Spanner

Provides strong consistency and scalability
Ideal for organization looking for consistency and scalability
Reduce operational overhead
### Cloud Data Warehouses

While databases store transactional data in an online fashion,  data warehouses assemble data from multiple sources, including databases. 

Databases are built and optimized to enable ingesting large amounts of data from many different sources efficiently.

Think of the data warehouse as the central hub for all business data. 

Different types of data can be transformed and consolidated into the warehouse, so they're useful for analysis. 
In particular, a Cloud data warehouse allows businesses to consolidate data that is structured and semi-structured.
#### Big query

BigQuery is a fully-managed data warehouse with downtime free upgrades  and maintenance and seamless scaling.
### Cloud Data Lakes
