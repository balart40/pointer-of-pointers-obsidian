## Chapter 9 Wealth is what you don't see

Modern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they make it a cherished industry. But the truth is that wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. 

The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see. 

The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency.
## Chapter 10 Save money

If you view it as powered by your own frugality and efficiency, the destiny is clearer. Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what you take in. And since you can build wealth without a high income, but have no chance of building wealth without a high savings rate, it’s clear which one matters more.

More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need.

Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.

The most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility.

People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them. 

So people’s ability to save is more in their control than they might think.

That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.

Having more control over your time and options is becoming one of the most valuable currencies in the world.

## Chapter 11 Reasonable > Rational

With it comes something that often goes overlooked: Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money.

That philosophy—aiming to be reasonable instead of rational—is one more people should consider when making decisions with their money.

“minimizing future regret” is hard to rationalize on paper but easy to justify in real life.

Neither rational or irrational ... reasonable.
## Chapter 12 Surprise

The most important events in historical data are the big outliers, the record-breaking events.

1. You’ll likely miss the outlier events that move the needle the most.
2. History can be a misleading guide to the future of the economy and stock market because it doesn’t account for structural changes that are relevant to today’s world.

The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising.

That doesn’t mean we should ignore history when thinking about money. But there’s an important nuance: The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be. General things like people’s relationship to greed and fear, how they behave under stress, and how they respond to incentives tend to be stable in time. The history of money is useful for that kind of stuff.
## Chapter 13 Room For error

Room for error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes and endurances let's you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from low-probability outcome fall in your favor.

So the person with enough room for error (cash) in part of their strategy to let them endure hardship in another (stock) has an edge over the person who gets wiped out.

 **Volatility**
- Can you survive your asses declining by 30%?
- Staying cash-flow positive
- Mentally?

Use room for error when estimating your future returns. This is more art than science.
A one third buffer is enough to allow to sleep well at night.

An important cousin of room for error is what i call optimism bias in risk-taking, or "Russian Roulette should statistically work" syndrome: An attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstances.

You just want to ensure you can remain standing long enough for my risks to pay off.

You have to survive to succeed 

The ability to do what you want, when you want,. for s long as you want, has an infinite ROI.

The biggest single point of failure with money is a sole reliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, with no savings to create a gap between what you think your expenses are and what they might be in the future.
## Chapter 14 You'll change

Imagining a goal is easy and fun. Imagining a goal in the context of the realistic life stresses that grow with competitive pursuits is something entirely different.

Sunk costs - anchoring decisions to past efforts that can't be refunded.
