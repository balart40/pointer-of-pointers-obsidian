## Introduction

Narcissism describes both a psychological and cultural condition.

### Individual level:

- Denotes a personality disturbance characterized by investment on one's image at the expense of the self.

Acting without feeling

Narcissist are more concerned how they appear than what they feel.

They deny feelings that contradict the image they seek

They Strive for power and control

### On the cultural level:

- Lack of concern for the environment, for the quality of life, for one's fellow human beings.
- Image over loss of human values

The narcissism of the individual parallels that of the culture. We shape our culture according to our image.

Many are quite successful in their work, which suggest a split between the way they perform in the world and what goes on inside.

**My theme is that narcissism denotes a degree of unreality in the individual and in the culture.**
**Unreality is not just neurotic, it verges on the psychotic.**

There is something crazy about a person who is out of touch with the reality of his or her being - the body and its feelings.

In general, insanity is seen as the mark of an individual who is out of touch  with the reality of his or her culture.

**And we need to know what is to be human, if we are to avoid becoming narcissists.**

My treatment of narcissistic patients is directed toward helping them get in touch with their bodies, to recover their suppressed feelings and to regain their lost humanity.

Without understanding, no therapeutic approach or technique is meaningful or effective on a deep level.

All patients are desperate for someone who will understand them.

They were not seen as individuals with feelings, not treated with respect for their humanity.
## A spectrum of narcissism

### Eric case

"I program my behavior so that it is effective in the world"

What is a feeling?
- It is a bodily function not a mental process

Love is not just respect and affection

He presented himself as someone committed to "doing  good for other"
But this image was a perversion of reality.
What he called "doing good for others" represented an exercise of power over them which, despite his stated good intentions, 
verged on the diabolical.

He got her girlfriend without any loving response on his part.

Such exploitativeness is a common to all narcissistic personalities.

The "I" who controlled the thing
### A definition of the narcissist 

Broad Picture: A narcissist becomes his own world and believes the whole world is him.

Otto Kernberg, a prominent psychoanalyst:
- Present various combinations of intense ambitiousness, grandiose fantasies, feelings of inferiority, and over-dependence on external admiration and acclaim 
- Chronic uncertainty and dissatisfaction about themselves, conscious or unconscious exploitiveness and ruthlessness to ward others. 

Problem develops in early childhood.

Kernberg points to the young child's "fusion of ideal self, ideal object and actual self-images as a defense against an intolerable reality in the interpersonal realm"

In effect, they cannot distinguish between an image of who they imagine themselves to be and an image of who they actually are.

The narcissist identifies with the idealized image.

Consciousness is concerned with images that regulate our actions.

The sense of self depends o the perception of what goes on in the living body.

They see the body as an instrument of the mind, subject to their will.
It operates only according to their images, without feeling.

Define narcissistic as a person whose behavior is not motivated by feeling.
### Narcissism versus hysteria

Narcissist lack what might be considered even a normal super-ego, providing some moral limits to sexual and other behavior.

Without sense of limits they tend to "act out" their impulses

There is an absence of self-restraint in their responses to people and situations.

The narcissistic predisposition is to depression whereas hysteria is to anxiety.

The denial of feelings and its relation to a lack of limits.
### Is there a primary narcissism?

Early stage of object-choice.
Possible failure of child to move from the stage of self-love (primary narcissism) to true object (other directed)

**Narcissism results from a distortion of development**. We need to look for something the parents did to the child rather than simply what they failed to do.

Children are often subjected to both kinds of trauma: Parents fail to provide sufficient nurturing and support on an emotional level by not recognizing and respecting their children's individuality.

But they also seductively try to mold them according to their image of how they should be.

**Children are often accused of seeking power over their parents when all they want is to have their needs understood and responded to.**

The parent's narcissism is projected onto the child: "I'm special therefore, my child is special"
### Different types of narcissistic disorder 

Narcissism is a spectrum, there are various degrees of disturbance or loss of self.

5 types of narcissistic disorder, according to the severity of the disorder and its special features
Thus the differences are both quantitative and qualitative
- Phalic-Narcissistic character
- Narcissistic character
- Borderline personality
- Psychopathic personality
- Paranoid personality 

The degree to which the persona identifies with his or her feelings is inversely proportional to the degree of narcissism

Narcissism as egotism, as an image rather than a feeling focus.

The antithesis between the ego (a mental organization) and the self (a body/feeling entity) exists in all adults rather than anyone who has developed a certain self-consciousness, which derive from the ability to form a self-image.

Because this ability is a function of the ego, narcissism is properly seen as disturbance of ego development.

Having a self-image is not narcissistic unless the image has a measure of grandiosity.
And what is grandiose can only be determined by reference to the actual self.

Grandiosity and thus narcissism, is a function of the discrepancy between the image and the self.
### The Phallic-Narcissistic Character

Behavior of men whose egos are invested in the seduction of women.

1926 Wilhelm Reich introduced this term, between compulsion neurosis and hysteria.

"Typical behavior is self-confident. often arrogant, elastic vigorous and often impressive"

Importance of this phallic-narcissism is two fold.
**1**
- Underlines the intimate connection between narcissism and sexuality, specifically in terms of erective potency.
**2**
- Relationship with loved one is more narcissistic than object-libidinal. 
- They ofter show strong attachments to people and things
- Exaggerated display of self-confidence, dignity and superiority
- Thanks to the free aggression is strong, impulsive, energetic and usually productive.

Hern emotional investment in me provided an extra measure of energy and excitement to my personality. Yet her need to posses me, and thus control me diminished my sense of self.
In this situation , my ego became bigger than my self, making me a narcissistic personality.

Hysteria comes from the Greek hysteria or "womb"

Female counterpart would be hysterical.

Preoccupied with her sexual image.
She is too, strong, impulsive, energetic and usually productive.
### The narcissistic character

Narcissistic characters can display numerous achievements and seeming success, for they often shown an ability to get along in the world of power and money.

Difference between the narcissistic character and the phallic is their fantasies.
- Phallic, women look him in admiration and men with envy
	- He recognize he may be inferior to others
### The borderline personality 

Their fa√ßade crumbles under emotional stress and the person reveals the helpess and frightened child within.

Other may present clinging personalities.

What differs, however is the degree of ego strength behind these fantasies.

Sometimes they are more afraid of success.

patient - "Sex should just be offered to me"

We have known for a long time that feelings of superiority and inferiority exists together.

Borderlines usually are with themselves totally great or totally worthless

The fantasy of "secret" greatness may then become all the more necessary, to counter the reality threat of worthlessness

Granted, an exact diagnosis is not necessary to begin treatment, for one should treat the individual, not the symptom.

Character disorder, would be expected to have a better developed ego and sense of self than the borderline personality. 

We may seek the cause for grandiosity in the parent's relation to the child, rather than in the child's relation to the parents.

How children see themselves often reflects how their parents saw and treated them.l
### The psychopathic personality

We should expect a greater degree of grandiosity, wether manifest or latent.

Narcissistic characters and psychopathic personalities show a need for instant gratification, an inability to contain desire or tolerate frustration.

Other respects - Their ability to manipulate people, organize and promote schemes, and attract followers 

Narcissistic characters and psychopathic personalities are anything  but infantile.
### The paranoid personality
