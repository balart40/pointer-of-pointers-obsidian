## Why Go

"Go is about language design in the service of software engineering" -  Rob Pike

- Reliable 
- Maintainable

"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute" - Harold Abelson

Simplicity
Clarity
Generality

"Is our basic tool, the language in which we design and code our programs, is also complicated, the language itself becomes part of the problem rather than part of its solution" -  Tony Hoare

"Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed and compiled language" - Go FAQ

Overall goals
- Simplicity, safety and readability
- ease of expressing algorithms
- orthogonality
- one right way to do 

Clear is better than clever -  Go Proverb
