## Chapter 9 Wealth is what you don't see

Modern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they make it a cherished industry. But the truth is that wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. 

The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see. 

The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency.
## Chapter 10 Save money

If you view it as powered by your own frugality and efficiency, the destiny is clearer. Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what you take in. And since you can build wealth without a high income, but have no chance of building wealth without a high savings rate, it’s clear which one matters more.

More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need.

Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.

The most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility.

People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them. 

So people’s ability to save is more in their control than they might think.

That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.

Having more control over your time and options is becoming one of the most valuable currencies in the world.

## Chapter 11 Reasonable > Rational

With it comes something that often goes overlooked: Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money.

That philosophy—aiming to be reasonable instead of rational—is one more people should consider when making decisions with their money.

“minimizing future regret” is hard to rationalize on paper but easy to justify in real life.

Neither rational or irrational ... reasonable.
