## Chapter 7 Freedom

## Chapter 8 Man in the Car Paradox

## Chapter 9 Wealth is what you don't see

Modern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they make it a cherished industry. But the truth is that wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. 

The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see. 

The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency.
## Chapter 10 Save money

If you view it as powered by your own frugality and efficiency, the destiny is clearer. Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what you take in. And since you can build wealth without a high income, but have no chance of building wealth without a high savings rate, it’s clear which one matters more.

More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need.

Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.

The most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility.

People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them. 

So people’s ability to save is more in their control than they might think.

That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.

Having more control over your time and options is becoming one of the most valuable currencies in the world.

## Chapter 11 Reasonable > Rational

With it comes something that often goes overlooked: Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money.

That philosophy—aiming to be reasonable instead of rational—is one more people should consider when making decisions with their money.

“minimizing future regret” is hard to rationalize on paper but easy to justify in real life.

Neither rational or irrational ... reasonable.
## Chapter 12 Surprise

The most important events in historical data are the big outliers, the record-breaking events.

1. You’ll likely miss the outlier events that move the needle the most.
2. History can be a misleading guide to the future of the economy and stock market because it doesn’t account for structural changes that are relevant to today’s world.

The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising.

That doesn’t mean we should ignore history when thinking about money. But there’s an important nuance: The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be. General things like people’s relationship to greed and fear, how they behave under stress, and how they respond to incentives tend to be stable in time. The history of money is useful for that kind of stuff.
## Chapter 13 Room For error

Room for error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes and endurances let's you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from low-probability outcome fall in your favor.

So the person with enough room for error (cash) in part of their strategy to let them endure hardship in another (stock) has an edge over the person who gets wiped out.

 **Volatility**
- Can you survive your asses declining by 30%?
- Staying cash-flow positive
- Mentally?

Use room for error when estimating your future returns. This is more art than science.
A one third buffer is enough to allow to sleep well at night.

An important cousin of room for error is what i call optimism bias in risk-taking, or "Russian Roulette should statistically work" syndrome: An attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstances.

You just want to ensure you can remain standing long enough for my risks to pay off.

You have to survive to succeed 

The ability to do what you want, when you want,. for s long as you want, has an infinite ROI.

The biggest single point of failure with money is a sole reliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, with no savings to create a gap between what you think your expenses are and what they might be in the future.
## Chapter 14 You'll change

Imagining a goal is easy and fun. Imagining a goal in the context of the realistic life stresses that grow with competitive pursuits is something entirely different.

Sunk costs - anchoring decisions to past efforts that can't be refunded.
## Chapter 15 Nothing's Free

"Every job looks easy when you're not the one doing it" - Jeff Immelt

Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But is currency is not dollars and cents. It's volatility, fear, doubt uncertainty, and regret - all of which are easy to overlook, until we are dealing with them in real time.
## Chapter 16 You and Me

In hindsight we're more likely to point cynical fingers than to learn lessons

The formation of bubbles isn't much about people irrationally participating in long-term investing,. They're about people somewhat rationally moving forward toward short-term trading to capture momentum that had been feeding on itself.

Profits will always be chased

A takeaway here is that few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing different games than you are.

the main thing I can recommend is going out of your way to identify what game you're playing.
## Chapter 17 The seduction of pessimism

“I am not an optimist. I am a very serious possibilist." - Hans Rosling

Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.

John Stuart Mill wrote in the 1840s: “I have observed that not the man who hopes when others despair, but the man who despairs when others hope, is admired by a large class of persons as a sage.”

Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.
## Chapter 18 When You'll believe anything

There is no greater force in finance than room for error, and the higher the stakes, the wider it should be.

1. The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of being true.
2. Everyone has a incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill the gaps.
## Chapter 19 All together now

Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/ compassion when they go wrong.

The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are both real and hard to identify. 
Do so when judging both yourself and others. 
Respect the power of luck and risk and you’ll have a better chance of focusing on things you can actually control. 
You’ll also have a better chance of finding the right role models.

Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see.

Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.

The foundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universal guidepost for all financial decisions.

If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful force in investing.

Become OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune,

Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.

Respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and chrome. 

Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save.

Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it.

Worship room for error. A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time.

Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions.

You should like risk because it pays off over time. But you should be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you from taking future risks that will pay off over time. 

Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game.

Respect the mess. 
There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you.
## Chapter 20 All together now

The most important financial decisions are not made in spreadsheets or in textbooks. They are made at the dinner table.

Nassim Taleb explained: “True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one’s activities for peace of mind.”
## Chapter 21 Confessions

I can afford to not be the greatest investor in the world, but I can’t afford to be a bad one.

My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades.

But to each their own. No one is crazy.
