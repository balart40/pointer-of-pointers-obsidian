## Preface: Dark Night of The Soul

"After years of being in relationships yet feeling emotionally alone"

## Introduction: A Primer On Holistic Psychology

Holistic psychology, tell a story, where physical and psychological symptoms are messages, not lifelong diagnoses that can only be managed.
## 1: You Are Your Own Best Healer

**First part** -> Foundations as we become aware of our "conscious self"
**Second part** -> We will enter the "mind"
- Conscious and subconscious 

But few were able to take that first step  from knowing to doing.

In order to achieve mental wellness, you must begin an active daily participant in your own healing

Inter-personal therapy a far more open-ended therapeutic model that uses the bond between client and practitioner as a catalyst for improving other relationships into the client's life. 

You will lear about the pull of the subconscious, the deeply embedded part of our psyche that hold our memories and is the source of our drives, or automatic instincts and motivations. 

In conclusion, addictions isn't limited to specific substances. 

**Emotional addiction** is particularly powerful when we habitually seek or avoid certain emotional stares as a way to cope.

Mindfulness provide not only self-awareness but also self-reflection.

Unfortunately, western medicine is constrained by the belief that the mind and body are separated entities. 

The Band-aid model of treating individual symptoms as they arise and never look at the underlying causes.

Only look for the (DSM-5) - The field has embraced the protocol of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

Disorder which is genetic / organic in origin and not environmental  or learned.

When we become a diagnosis it decreases inventive to change or try to explore root causes.

Now we believe in genetic causes of diagnoses, called **genetic determinism**.

In this dynamic we are not active participants in our own health and wellness. 

We accept that each of us have been handed down a destiny in our DNA and we can do almost nothing about it.

Thus we become helpless and dependent.
### The power of transform 

The groundbreaking discovery of epigenetics tells a new story about our ability to change.

Biologist Bruce Lipton has been spreading the gospel about the role of epigenetic for years.
### The placebo effect


### Holistic Psychology

We can actively participate in our mental wellness.

We can learn in the effects of chronic inflammation on the brain thanks to the emerging field of psychoneuroimmunology.

1. Healing is a daily event. You can "go somewhere to be healed"; you must go inward to be healed. This means a daily commitment to doing the work. You are responsible for your healing and will be active participant in that process. Y**our level of activity is directly connected to your level of healing**. Small and consistent choices are the path to deep transformation.
2. Though many things are beyond our control the power of choice enables healing
3. Subconscious is threatened by change, "pull toward the familiar"
4. Take responsibility for your mental wellness

"Most of all, it was the understanding that her deepest wounds were not caused by others, but by her betraying her intuitive Self"

"she discovered that it felt safer to be kinder to her future self, and her writing reflected that softer approach"

- The more she wrote about herself in a kinder way, the more she began to notice the constant chatter of negative self talk
- the more she started to trust herself, the quieter the chatter became and the more her daily acts of self-care and self-love started to extend 
## 2 The Conscious Self: Becoming Aware

We try to numb all the anxieties and what-ifs with smoke/drugs/etc all to relax and quiet the inner critic.

"Every thought that crossed her mind became a relief, a communication , expressed by her core Self"

"Yet we want others to see through all of our layers of self-betrayal and into our core selves"

"but our attempts to do so failed because we don't understand our own minds and bodies"
### You are not your thoughts 

Everything that follows is grounded in awakening your conscious awareness.

"Your are the thinker of your thoughts, not the thoughts themselves"

### The conscious self and the subconscious self
