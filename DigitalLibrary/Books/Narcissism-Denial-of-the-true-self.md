## Introduction

Narcissism describes both a psychological and cultural condition.

### Individual level:

- Denotes a personality disturbance characterized by investment on one's image at the expense of the self.

Acting without feeling

Narcissist are more concerned how they appear than what they feel.

They deny feelings that contradict the image they seek

They Strive for power and control

### On the cultural level:

- Lack of concern for the environment, for the quality of life, for one's fellow human beings.
- Image over loss of human values

The narcissism of the individual parallels that of the culture. We shape our culture according to our image.

Many are quite successful in their work, which suggest a split between the way they perform in the world and what goes on inside.

**My theme is that narcissism denotes a degree of unreality in the individual and in the culture.**
**Unreality is not just neurotic, it verges on the psychotic.**

There is something crazy about a person who is out of touch with the reality of his or her being - the body and its feelings.

In general, insanity is seen as the mark of an individual who is out of touch  with the reality of his or her culture.

**And we need to know what is to be human, if we are to avoid becoming narcissists.**

My treatment of narcissistic patients is directed toward helping them get in touch with their bodies, to recover their suppressed feelings and to regain their lost humanity.

Without understanding, no therapeutic approach or technique is meaningful or effective on a deep level.

All patients are desperate for someone who will understand them.

They were not seen as individuals with feelings, not treated with respect for their humanity.
## A spectrum of narcissism

### Eric case

"I program my behavior so that it is effective in the world"

What is a feeling?
- It is a bodily function not a mental process

Love is not just respect and affection

He presented himself as someone committed to "doing  good for other"
But this image was a perversion of reality.
What he called "doing good for others" represented an exercise of power over them which, despite his stated good intentions, 
verged on the diabolical.

He got her girlfriend without any loving response on his part.

Such exploitativeness is a common to all narcissistic personalities.

The "I" who controlled the thing
### A definition of the narcissist 

Broad Picture: A narcissist becomes his own world and believes the whole world is him.

Otto Kernberg, a prominent psychoanalyst:
- Present various combinations of intense ambitiousness, grandiose fantasies, feelings of inferiority, and over-dependence on external admiration and acclaim 
- Chronic uncertainty and dissatisfaction about themselves, conscious or unconscious exploitiveness and ruthlessness to ward others. 

Problem develops in early childhood.

Kernberg points to the young child's "fusion of ideal self, ideal object and actual self-images as a defense against an intolerable reality in the interpersonal realm"

In effect, they cannot distinguish between an image of who they imagine themselves to be and an image of who they actually are.

The narcissist identifies with the idealized image.

Consciousness is concerned with images that regulate our actions.

The sense of self depends o the perception of what goes on in the living body.

They see the body as an instrument of the mind, subject to their will.
It operates only according to their images, without feeling.

Define narcissistic as a person whose behavior is not motivated by feeling.
