## Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business

Innovation comes in waves and is powered by breakthrough technology.

**Paradigm Shift**
- A fundamental and irreversible change in the way that humans work and engage with the world

**Digital Transformation**
- When an organization uses new digital technologies, such as public, private, and hybrid cloud platforms to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet the needs of changing business and market dynamics.

Organizations choose digital transformation to
- Forster innovation
- Generate new revenue streams
- Adapt to market changes
- Adapt to customer needs

Digital transformation helps organizations in
- Change how they operate
- Redefine relationships
- Modernize applications
- Create services
- Deliver value
### What's in the cloud

Implementations
- On-premises
	- Hosted on-site
	- Does not require 3rd party access
	- Require physical space, specialized room, expert personal
	- Difficult to scale
- Private Cloud
	- Single-tenant or corporate cloud
	- Self-service
	- Scalability
	- Elasticity
- Public Cloud
	- Multi-tenant
	- Cloud = Public cloud
	- On-demand availability
	- No need to manage resources
	- IaaS: Infrastructure As A Service
	- PaaS: Platform as a service
	- SaaS: Software as a service
- Hybrid cloud
	- On-premises data center with a cloud-like google cloud
- Multi cloud
	- Combine two public cloud providers
### The benefits of cloud computing

**Scalable**

### Cloud Era

### Challenges that lead to digital transformation

- Understanding and using data
- Best technology infrastructure
- Create the best hybrid workplace
- Know their data, systems, and users are secure
- Priority sustainability

### Google Transformation Cloud

**Data**

But becoming a data-driven company can be difficult if data sets a siloed across operational and analytical data stores

A data cloud is a unified solution to manage data across the entire data life  cycle regardless of whether it sits in Google Cloud or in other clouds. 

It lets organizations identify and process data with great scale, speed, security and reliability. 

An open infrastructure cloud facilitates fast innovation and  reduces lock into a single cloud provider.  By giving organizations a choice and flexibility to build, migrate and  manager applications across on premises and multiple clouds

**Open standard** refers to software that follows particular specifications  that are openly accessible and usable by anyone They have guidelines for software functionality,  which help avoid vendor lock in and ensure that the products that use these standards  are forming an interoperable way

**Open source** refers to software whose source code is publicly accessible and  free for anyone to use, modify and share.  A decentralized community generally develops open source software as a public collaboration based on the philosophy of transparency and the open exchange of ideas.

## Fundamental Cloud Concepts

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Capital Expenditures

Operating Expenses

**Private**
Virtualized servers in its own data centers

Hybrid
Combination environments such as Private and public cloud

Multicloud
Combines at least two public cloud providers

Multiple Clouds
- Access to the latest technologies
- Modernize at the right pace
	- Migrate at a pace that makes sense
	- transform technical infra over time
- Improved return of investment
	- Expand cloud computing capacity without increasing data center expenses
	- Reduce capex or general spending
	- Improve transparency
- Flexibility through choice of tools
	- Wider choice of tools and developer talent
	- better response to changing market demands
	- avoid vendor lock-in concerns
- Improve reliability and resiliency
	- Distribute core workloads across multiple cloud and on-premises infrastructure
	- reduce downtime
	- reduce concerns about over-dependance on a single source of failure
- Maintain regulatory compliance
	- Ensure compliance with regional data, governance, residency or digital sovereignty requirements
- running apps on-premises
	- Freedom to innovate while still meeting legacy technology needs
- Running apps at remote edge locations
	- Meet performance and latency requirements
	- run select apps at the network edge

### how a network supports digital transformation

**IP:** Internet Protocol
**Domain:** Maps to an IP address or a set of IP addresses
Domain Name System (DNS): Store a database of domain names mapped to IP addresses that can be queried and used by computers to communicate with each other.

### Network performance bandwidth and latency

**Bandwidth**
- Measure of how much data a network transfer in a given amount of time
- It's measures in megabits per second (Mbps) or Gigabits per second (Gbps)
- A higher bandwidth allows a computer to download information more quickly

**Latency**
-  the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another
- measure in milliseconds
- describes delays in communication

Availability
Durability
Latency

**Location**
**Region**
- Independent geographic areas
- composed of zones
**Zones**

## Cloud Computing Models and Shared Responsibility

- **IaaS**
	- Infrastructure As A Service
		- Compute, Storage
- **PaaS**
	- Product As A Service
		- Development deployment environment
- SaaS
	- Software As A Service
		- Complete application and services
### Computing service models

In the pyramid below the abstraction level is higher as you go up in the pyramid

```
		 ^
		/ \
	   /   \ 
	  /SaaS \
     /       \
	/  PaaS   \
   /           \
  /    IaaS     \

```

#### IaaS

IaaS is a computing model that offers the on demand availability of almost infinitely scalable infrastructure resources such as compute, networking, storage and databases as services over the Internet.

It provides the same technologies and capabilities as traditional data center without having top physically maintain or manage all of it.

Benefits
- Economical
	- Only pay for what you use
- Efficient
	- Resource available
- Boost productivity 
	- IT saves time and money
- Reliable
	- No single point of failure
- Scalable

**Scenarios where IaaS would be good for**

- Unpredictable workload volumes or need to move quickly in response to business fluctuations
- Require more infrastructure scalability and agility than traditional data centers can provide
- High business growth that outpaces infrastructure capabilities 
- Unpredictable spikes in demand for infrastructure services
- Low utilization of existing infrastructure resources

#### PaaS

- Provides a platform for developers to develop, run and manage their own apps
- No need to build and maintain the associated infrastructure
- Can use built-in software components to build applications
- reduces the amount of code to be written

Benefits
- Reduces development time
- Scalable
- Reduces Management
- Flexible

**Scenarios where PaaS would be good for**

- Create unique and custom applications without investing in owning  and managing infrastructure
- rapidly test and deploy applications
- Have legacy applications and want to reduce the cost of operations
- Have a new app project that they want to deploy quickly by growing and updating the app as fast as possible
- Want to only pay for resources while they're being used
#### SaaS

**Benefits**
- Low Maintenance
- Cost-effective
- Flexible

**Scenarios where SaaS would be good for**
- Want to use standard software solutions that require minimal customization
- Don't want to invest time or internal expertise in maintaining applications or infrastructure
- need more time for IT teams to focus on strategic projects
- need to access apps from various devices and locations

### Choosing cloud computing model

**IaaS**
- If they are looking for a highly flexible scalable service while maintaining control of infrastructure
**PaaS**
- A platform designed for building software products
**SaaS**
- Ready-to-use feature without the hassle of installations

### The shared responsibility model

Security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the customer

Security of the cloud
- Cloud provider
Security in the cloud
- customer

If you configure or store it, you are responsible for securing it

Cloud Provider

| **Cloud Provider** | **Customer** |
|:-:|:-:|
| Hardware | Configurations |
| Networks| Access policies|
| Physical security| User Data|

Customers are always responsible for the security for their data
